# Library Management System — Software Engineering Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Library Management System** designed and documented as part of a Software Engineering course. It helps manage library operations such as adding books, borrowing books, and returning books. The repository contains design artifacts including use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and data flow diagrams to clearly describe the system’s structure and behavior.

## 🧠 Features

* 📚 **Add Book** — Process for librarians to add new books to the system.
* 📖 **Borrow Book** — Tracks book lending and borrower details.
* 🔁 **Return Book** — Handles returning books and updating availability.
* 📊 **Diagrams & Models** — UML and DFD artifacts to showcase system design.

## 📈 System Design Diagrams

### 🔹 Use Case Diagram

Shows the interactions between users (librarians/members) and the system to perform key library tasks.

### 🔹 Activity Diagrams

Visualize the workflow for:

* Adding a new book
* Borrowing a book
* Returning a book

### 🔹 Sequence Diagrams

Illustrate the step-by-step interactions between system components for each scenario (e.g., adding or returning a book).

### 🔹 Class Diagram

Defines the main classes (e.g., `Book`, `Member`, `Loan`) and their relationships.

### 🔹 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Demonstrates how data moves through the system, including user input, processing, and data stores.

## 🛠 How to Use This Project

This repository currently contains **design documentation only** and no executable code. You can use the artifacts here to:

1. Understand the system requirements and design.
2. Generate code or start implementation based on the provided diagrams.
3. Extend the system with additional features (searching, member management, reporting, etc.).
